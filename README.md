# scripts-rpi-azureiothub
sample python scripts for using raspberry pi with a temperature sensor and Azure IoT Hub

Inside the TemperatureSensor folder is a python project that can send telemetry to Azure IoT Hub from the temperature sensed by the Raspberry Pi.

The scripts are separate programs each testing a certain functionality related to the temperature sensor or Azure IoT Hub from the client side (the Raspberry Pi)

The keys used in the project are no longer functional make sure you change them if you want to test.

Used the Azure IoT Hub python samples (client side) for reference.
