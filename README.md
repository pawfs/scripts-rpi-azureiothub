# scripts-rpi-azureiothub
sample python scripts for using raspberry pi with a temperature sensor and Azure IoT Hub

Inside the TemperatureSensor folder is a python project that can send telemetry to Azure IoT Hub from the temperature sensed by the Raspberry Pi.

The scripts are separate programs each testing a certain functionality related to the temperature sensor or Azure IoT Hub from the client side (the Raspberry Pi)

Used the Azure IoT Hub python samples (client side) for reference.
